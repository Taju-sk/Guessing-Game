# Guessing-Game 
In this game we have to guess a random number. If the guessed number matches with the random number then we win else we get notification like "Too High" if the gussed number is greater than the generated random number and "Too Low" if the gussed number is less than the generated random number.
I have developed this using HTML,CSS and JavaScript i.e, by manipulating the HTML elements using DOM.
You can find the random number in console.
